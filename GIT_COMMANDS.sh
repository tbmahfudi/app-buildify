git commit -m "feat: Implement Option A MVP - Auth & Org CRUD

Complete implementation of authentication system and organization management.

Backend Features:
- User model with JWT authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- Auth endpoints: login, refresh, me
- RBAC with role-based access control
- Complete CRUD for companies, branches, departments
- PostgreSQL and MySQL migrations with proper dependencies
- Database session management with dependency injection
- Seed data for organizations and users

Frontend Features:
- Auth integration with automatic token refresh
- Companies management UI with full CRUD operations
- Protected routes requiring valid JWT
- Token management in localStorage
- Bootstrap 5 responsive interface

DevOps:
- Docker Compose for local development (PostgreSQL + MySQL)
- Makefile with quick commands (setup, migrate, seed, run)
- Automated API test script with RBAC validation
- Comprehensive documentation (SETUP.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

Test Credentials:
- admin@example.com / admin123 (superuser, all permissions)
- user@example.com / user123 (regular user with tenant)
- viewer@example.com / viewer123 (read-only access)

Breaking Changes: None (initial implementation)
Migration Required: Yes (run: alembic upgrade head)
