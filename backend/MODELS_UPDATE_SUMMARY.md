# Multi-Tenant Architecture Models - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete multi-tenant architecture with 16 database models, all using consistent GUID (UUID) support for PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## What Was Done

### 1. Base Infrastructure (1 file)
**backend/app/models/base.py**
- ✅ Created custom GUID type that works with PostgreSQL (native UUID) and MySQL (String(36))
- ✅ TypeDecorator handles automatic conversion between databases
- ✅ Added generate_uuid() helper function
- ✅ Ensures consistent UUID handling across all models

### 2. Core Tenant Models (5 files)

**backend/app/models/tenant.py** (NEW)
- ✅ Top-level tenant entity
- ✅ Subscription management (tier, status, limits)
- ✅ Usage tracking (companies, users, storage)
- ✅ Relationships to companies, users, groups, roles
- ✅ Primary key: GUID

**backend/app/models/company.py** (UPDATED)
- ✅ Added tenant_id (FK to tenants)
- ✅ Updated to use GUID for all IDs
- ✅ Added comprehensive address and contact fields
- ✅ Added relationships to tenant, branches, departments, user_accesses, groups
- ✅ UniqueConstraint on (tenant_id, code)

**backend/app/models/branch.py** (UPDATED)

- ✅ Added helper methods:
  - has_company_access(company_id, access_level)
  - get_accessible_companies()
  - get_permissions()

### 3. Multi-Company Access (1 file)

**backend/app/models/user_company_access.py** (NEW)
- ✅ Junction table for user-to-company access

- ✅ Optional branch/department restrictions
- ✅ Tracks who granted access and when
- ✅ UniqueConstraint on (user_id, company_id)

### 4. RBAC Models (4 files)

**backend/app/models/permission.py** (NEW)
- ✅ Atomic permissions with format: resource:action:scope
- ✅ Fields: code, name, description, resource, action, scope, category
- ✅ Composite index on (resource, action, scope)
- ✅ is_system flag to protect system permissions

**backend/app/models/role.py** (NEW)
- ✅ System roles (tenant_id = NULL) and tenant roles

- ✅ Relationships to tenant, company, user_groups, group_roles
- ✅ UniqueConstraint on (tenant_id, company_id, code)

**backend/app/models/rbac_junctions.py** (NEW)
- ✅ RolePermission: Assigns permissions to roles
- ✅ UserRole: Assigns roles directly to users
- ✅ UserGroup: Adds users to groups
- ✅ GroupRole: Assigns roles to groups
- ✅ All with UniqueConstraints to prevent duplicates

### 5. Supporting Models (3 files)

**backend/app/models/audit.py** (UPDATED)
- ✅ Updated to use GUID for all IDs
- ✅ Added company_id, branch_id, department_id for multi-tenant context
- ✅ Added request_method, request_path, error_code, duration_ms
- ✅ Added composite index on (tenant_id, company_id)

**backend/app/models/settings.py** (UPDATED)
- ✅ Updated UserSettings to use GUID
- ✅ Updated TenantSettings to use GUID
- ✅ Both models ready for multi-tenant architecture

**backend/app/models/metadata.py** (UPDATED)
- ✅ Updated EntityMetadata to use GUID
- ✅ Consistent with other models

### 6. Module Exports (1 file)

**backend/app/models/__init__.py** (UPDATED)
- ✅ Comprehensive exports of all 16 models
- ✅ Exports Base, GUID, generate_uuid
- ✅ Clear categorization and documentation

## Complete Model List (16 Models)

### Core Entities (5)
1. Tenant - Top-level tenant entity
2. Company - Business units within tenant
3. Branch - Physical locations
4. Department - Functional units
5. User - System users

### Access Control (1)
6. UserCompanyAccess - Multi-company access mapping

- User → Companies (N:M via UserCompanyAccess)

### ✅ Comprehensive RBAC
- Permissions (atomic rights)
- Roles (collections of permissions)

- Department hierarchy support
- User assignment to branch/department

### ✅ Audit Trail

- Request metadata and performance tracking

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE/SET NULL
- Unique constraints on business keys
- Composite indexes for performance
- Soft deletes (deleted_at)

## Database Relationships

```
Tenant (1) → Companies (N)
Tenant (1) → Users (N)
Tenant (1) → Groups (N)
Tenant (1) → Roles (N)

Company (1) → Branches (N)
Company (1) → Departments (N)
Company (1) → Groups (N)
Company (N) → Users (M) via UserCompanyAccess

Branch (1) → Departments (N)

User (N) → Roles (M) via UserRole
User (N) → Groups (M) via UserGroup

Group (N) → Roles (M) via GroupRole

Role (N) → Permissions (M) via RolePermission
```

## Migration Path from Old Design

### Breaking Changes
1. **User.tenant_id** now points to tenants table (was company ID)
2. **Company.tenant_id** is now required
3. **User.roles** JSON field removed (use proper RBAC)
4. All IDs now use GUID type

### Steps to Migrate
1. Create tenants table
2. Create one tenant per existing company
3. Update companies with tenant_id
4. Update users with new tenant_id
5. Create user_company_access records
6. Migrate roles from JSON to RBAC tables
7. Update application code to use new structure

## Testing

✅ All Python files have valid syntax
✅ All models properly structured
✅ All relationships defined
✅ All constraints in place

## Next Steps

1. **Create Database Migrations**
   - Use Alembic to generate migrations
   - Support PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

2. **Create Seed Data**
   - System permissions
   - System roles (superuser, admin, user, viewer)
   - Sample tenant with companies
   - Sample users with access

3. **Update API Endpoints**
   - Tenant CRUD
   - Company CRUD
   - User-company access management
   - RBAC management
   - Add company context to requests

4. **Update Authentication**
   - Include tenant_id in JWT tokens
   - Include company context
   - Update middleware for tenant/company isolation

5. **Test the System**
   - Unit tests for models
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - Test multi-database support
   - Test permission checking
